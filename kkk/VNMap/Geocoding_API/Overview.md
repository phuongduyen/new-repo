### Nominatim API

Nominatim indexes named (or numbered) features within the OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset and a subset of other unnamed features (pubs, hotels, churches, etc).

Its API has the following endpoints for querying the data:

 * __[/search](Search.md)__ - search OSM objects by name or type
 * __[/reverse](Reverse.md)__ - search OSM object by their location
 * __/status__ - query the status of the server
 * __[/details](Details.md)__ - show internal details for an object (for debugging only)
